Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attacks. These attacks are typically aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money, or interrupting normal business processes. 
Effective cybersecurity requires a multi-layered approach involving people, processes, and technology. 
Key Components
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad): The core goals of cybersecurity are to ensure that data is kept confidential (not disclosed to unauthorized individuals), maintains integrity (not modified), and is available to authorized users when needed.
Threat Landscape: The digital world presents a vast and evolving landscape of threats, including ransomware, phishing scams, data theft, and state-sponsored attacks.
Shared Responsibility: From individuals using smart devices to government entities managing critical infrastructure, everyone has a role to play in maintaining a secure digital environment.
